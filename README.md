# English to Hinglish Machine Translation using T5-Small

This project utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library and the pretrained model "[t5-small](https://huggingface.co/t5-small)" to perform English to Hinglish machine translation. The model is fine-tuned for the specific use case and trained on the [findnitai/english-to-hinglish dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/findnitai/english-to-hinglish).

## Instructions

To train the model for English to Hinglish translation, follow these steps:

1. Open the `model_train.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. Execute the cells in the notebook to train the model using the provided dataset.

For performing inference (translation), follow these steps:

1. Open the `inference.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. Execute the cells in the notebook to use the trained model for translating English text to Hinglish.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need access to Google Colab, as the provided notebooks are designed for that environment.
